# Placeholder PNG Files

Since I cannot generate actual PNG images, you'll need to convert the SVG files to PNG format. 

For now, you can create simple placeholder PNG files by:

1. Opening any image editing software (Paint, GIMP, Photoshop, etc.)
2. Creating new images with these dimensions:
   - icon16.png: 16x16 pixels
   - icon48.png: 48x48 pixels  
   - icon128.png: 128x128 pixels
3. Fill them with a blue background (#0078d4) and save as PNG
4. Or use the provided SVG files and convert them using online tools

The extension will work with placeholder icons, but for the best experience, convert the SVG files to PNG.
